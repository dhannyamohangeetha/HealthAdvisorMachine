    	<h4>YOU ARE AT HIGH RISK OF HAVING A HEART ATTACK. PLEASE FOLLOW DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS.</h4>
		<h4>There are several steps people can take to reduce their risk of heart attack:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Maintain a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet that is low in saturated fats,
				trans fats, and cholesterol can help lower the risk of heart attack. A diet rich
				in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats like omega-3
				fatty acids can help keep the heart healthy.</li><br>

			<li>Exercise regularly: Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and reduces
				the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, which are all
				risk factors for heart attack. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity
				exercise, such as brisk walking, most days of the week.</li><br>

			<li>Quit smoking: Smoking is a major risk factor for heart attack, and quitting
				smoking can significantly reduce the risk. Seek help from a healthcare provider
				or smoking cessation program if needed.</li><br>

			<li>Manage stress: Chronic stress can increase the risk of heart attack, so it's
				important to find ways to manage stress. Some effective stress-management
				techniques include yoga, meditation, deep breathing exercises, and spending
				time with loved ones.</li><br>

			<li>Control other health conditions: If you have other health conditions such as
				high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, work with your healthcare
				provider to manage these conditions effectively. This can help reduce the risk
				of heart attack.</li><br>

			<li>It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice on
				reducing the risk of heart attack.</li><br>
